This php application will serve to create an CRM for an Airport Valet Service.

From the front end:
    The customer will contact a valet agent who will check if the customer is 
    currently in the customer database. 
        If they are not they will create an appropriate entry in the database.
        
    The valet will determine whether the customer wants personal parking 
    (uncovered parking), preferred parking (covered parking), and any potential
    parking plusses (oil change, headlight defogging, "park and polish" 
    (includes exterior cleaning) or "park and primp" (includes interior/exterior
    detailing). 
    
    The valet agent will then create a record of car drop off. This record will
    include time/date information, parking location, "parking plusses", and rate
    info. 
    
    The valet will print a reciept for the customer. Hopefully there will be a 
    paper that can be easily seperated into two parts, one to send with the 
    customer and another to easily attatch to the key. (perhaps have numbered
    keyrings?)
    
    Customer departs.
    
    When customer returns they will be able to present the reciept to the valet
    attendant, valet attendant will find correct key and vehicle 
    location/information by reciept number. 
    
    Amount due will be calculated based on time, parking type, and any "parking
    plusses".
    
    Customer will pay amount due.
    Ticket closes.
    
    Attendant will retrieve vehicle, customer will inspect vehicle and depart.
